# EventsApp

<h2>Work in progress...</h2>
<br>
Project done with Xcode and Swift. Using Google Firebase for the user authentication and database.
<br>
Simplified the idea of the application is, that the user can create events (private or public).
<br>
If private, user can invite friends to join and only invited people can see the event.
<br>
If public, anyone can see the event and join.
